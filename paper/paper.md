# Summary

Microorganisms found in natural environments are fundamental components of ecosystems and play vital roles in various ecological processes. Studying their genomes can provide valuable insights into the diversity, functionality, and evolution of microbial life, as well as their impacts on human health. Once the genetic material is extracted from environmental samples, it undergoes sequencing using advanced technologies like whole genome sequencing (WGS). The raw sequence data is then analysed, and computational methods are applied to assemble the fragmented sequences and reconstruct the complete microbial genomes. 

Many microorganisms including archaea, bacteria, plasmids, viruses, and bacteriophages, can have circular genomes. However, a circular genome sequence once assembled is represented as a linear character string and labelled in some way to indicate that it should be circular. The point at which the linear sequence begins is random, due to the nature of the algorithms employed in assembling genomes from sequencing reads. Such arbitrary startpoints can affect downstream genome annotation and analysis; they may occur within coding sequences (CDS), can disrupt the prediction potential mobile genetic elements like prophages, and make pangenome analyses based on gene order difficult. Therefore, microbial sequences are often required to be reoriented to begin by convention with certain genes: the dnaA chromosomal replication initiator gene for bacterial chromosomes, the repA plasmid replication initiation gene for plasmids and the terL large terminase subunit gene for bacteriophages as shown in \autoref{fig:workflow}. Here we present Dnaapler, a flexible microbial sequence reorientation tool that allows for rapid and consistent orientation of circular microbial genomes such as bacteria, plasmids and bacteriophages. Dnaapler is hosted on GitHub at [github.com/gbouras13/dnaapler](https://github.com/gbouras13/dnaapler).

# Statement of need

Circlator [@Hunt:2015] is the most commonly used dedicated tool for reorienting bacterial genomes. However, Circlator was designed for bacterial chromosomes and plasmids only, is no longer supported by its developers, has several burdensome external dependencies, and requires both the corrected reads in FASTA or FASTQ format along with the FASTA genome assembly as input. Alternatively, genome reorientation is often performed manually or with custom scripts on a genome-by-genome and project-by-project basis, making integration into assembly workflows difficult and creating a lack of consistency between different projects and researchers. We propose Dnaapler, a light-weight command-line tool written in Python 3 that can easily be integrated into assembly workflows. Dnaapler takes only a FASTA formatted genome file as input. It uses the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) [@altschul:1990; @mount:2007] or Pyrodigal [@Larralde:2022] [@Hyatt:2010] depending on the chosen subcommand for reorientation. A list of the subcommands provided in Dnaapler are as follows:

| Subcommand | Database used                                                                 | Gene used to reorient                       |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| chromosome | Custom database downloaded from Swissprot                                     | dnaA chromosomal replication initiator gene |
| plasmid    | repA database curated from Unicycler [@Wick:2017]                             | repA plasmid replication initiation gene    |
| phage      | Prokaryotic Virus Remote Homologous Groups database (PHROGs) [@Terzian:2021]  | terL large terminase subunit gene           |
| custom     | User specified                                                                | Custom gene                                 |
| mystery    | Pyrodigal predicted coding sequences                                          | random CDS                                  |
| nearest    | Pyrodigal predicted coding sequences                                          | first CDS (nearest to the start)            |
| bulk       | Either chromosome, plasmid, phage or custom. Requires multiple input contigs. | dnaA, repA, terL or a custom gene           |


Specifically, Dnaapler 'chromosome', 'phage' and 'plasmid' subcommands use blastx (protein databases are searched using a translated nucleotide query) to search for the dnaA, terL or repA gene respectively in the input genomes, using built-in amino acid databases for each gene. Dnaapler will check that the first amino acid of the identified start site begins with Methionine, Valine, or Leucine (the 3 most used gene start codons in bacteria and bacteriophages) and will then reorient the genome to begin with this gene in the forward direction. If the 'custom' subcommand is selected, the same process will be conducted but with a user specified amino acid FASTA formatted input database. If the 'mystery' or 'nearest' subcommands are selected, Pyrodigal will be used to predict all coding sequences, and the genome will be reoriented to begin with either a random (mystery) or the first (nearest) CDS, respectively. Dnaapler returns an output directory containing a log file and the genome reoriented as a FASTA formatted file. Finally, the 'bulk' subcommand can be used to reorient multiple input contigs (in a mulitFASTA format file) either either the chromosome, plasmid, phage or custom reorientation strategies.

Dnaapler has already been integrated into the United States of America StaPH-B (State Public Health Lab Bioinformatics) consortium [Docker image collection](https://github.com/StaPH-B/docker-builds).

# Availability

Dnaapler is distributed on PyPI. A [Conda](https://conda.io/) package is
also available in the Bioconda channel [@Bioconda:2018]. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/gbouras13/dnaapler),
and features Continuous Integration tests and test coverage, and Continuous Deployment using Github actions.
